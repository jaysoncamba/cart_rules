# 🍎 Cart Checkout System with Flexible Pricing Rules

This is a flexible cart and checkout system designed in Ruby on Rails that allows dynamic pricing rules using Single Table Inheritance (STI). The system supports common promotional pricing strategies like:

* **Buy-One-Get-One-Free** (BOGO)
* **Bulk Discounts**
* **Percentage Discounts**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This system powers a dynamic checkout experience where pricing rules can change frequently due to executive decisions. The checkout engine recalculates totals based on the rules attached to specific products.

Each rule type has its own logic for applying discounts:

* **BogoRule**: Buy 1 Get 1 Free
* **BulkDiscountRule**: Reduced unit price if a quantity threshold is met
* **PercentageDiscountRule**: Applies a percentage discount on all items once a threshold is reached

Products and rules are seeded into the database and can be updated easily for new campaigns or changes in company strategy.

---

## 📋 Assumptions

* All monetary values are rounded to **two decimal places** after computations.
* Rules are **product-specific** and determined by `product_code`.
* The cart stores quantity and product details internally using `product.code`.
* Pricing rules are applied **independently** per product (no cross-product promotions).
* Rule logic is separated using **STI**, making it extendable without modifying core cart logic.
* The total is recalculated only when the cart changes (dirty checking enabled).
* A product can have **only one active rule** at a time.

## 🧪 Example Rules Setup

* **Green Tea (`GR1`)** – Buy-One-Get-One-Free
* **Strawberries (`SR1`)** – €4.50 each if 3 or more are bought
* **Coffee (`CF1`)** – 33.33% off if 3 or more are bought
